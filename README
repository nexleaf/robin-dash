Fork of robin-dash dashboard for robin-mesh

Current fork of robin-dash 0.7b6, available here: http://code.google.com/p/robin-dash/

Robin-mesh available here: http://www.robin-mesh.net/


Changes:

  - Store and forward checking helps when you are trying to sync up an dashboard
    deployed 'in field' that my have a poor+flaky connection to the real main
    dashboard. It makes the dual checkin work to your own secondary dashboard
    asynchronously and reliably.    

  - Added store and forward checkins. All checkins will be stored to a file.
    You must add the resources/scripts/storeandforwardcheckin.py to cron with
    two parameters. The first is the path to the settings file, the second is
    the network name.

  - Added root dashboard setting. Ensures that root dashboard will not
    try to store and forward.
